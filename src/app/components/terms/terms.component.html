      <h2>2. Overview of UhX sale</h2>
      <p>UhX is required for proper operation and comprehensive utilization of UhX (as defined in the white paper (the “White Paper”) provided at https://UhX.io (the “Website”) as of the date the Purchaser acquires UhX token). After the UhX sale, each UhX is backed by the purchase of the underlying assets, as described in the White Paper. To the extent they do not contradict these Terms, the rights connected to UhX are subject to the limitations set out in the White Paper, but this should in no case create obligations for the Company in addition to the ones contained in these Terms. The Company reserves the right to circumvent the algorithm used to select the underlying assets if it believes, in its sole discretion, that such selected underlying assets could adversely affect the Company or UhX from a regulatory or legal perspective. The Company shall have the right to sell any such underlying assets (if already part of UhX portfolio) and block their acquisition.</p>
      <p>The maximum total amount of UhXs to be issued is 200,000,000 during the 2018 Utility Token Sale. UhXs are granted as Purchasers buy. Ownership of UhX during the UhX token sale carries no rights express or implied. Purchases of UhX are non-refundable.</p>
      <h2>3. UhX Price</h2>
      <p>Purchasers in the UhX token sale will be allocated their UhX tokens in exchange for an equivalent fiat or crypto asset value. The price of UhX will be $1.00 USD.</p>
      <p>The US Dollars to XLM exchange rate is used to dynamically set the XLM to UhX rate. As a result, for the duration of the UhX sale, the price to purchase a UhX will be set as an amount in XLM. The same will go for BTC and ETH.</p>
      <p>Purchaser must have an UhX wallet in order to receive any UhX purchased from the Company.</p>
      <h2>4. Timing of UhX Token Sale</h2>
      <p>The UhX sale begins at 0800 ET on July 2nd, 2018 - The UhX sale will run for 45 calendar days and will end on the August 14th, 2018 or when the UhX 2018 sale cap is reached. The Company reserves the right to change the sale dates or extend the sale duration for any reason, including the unavailability of the Website or other unforeseen security or procedural issues.</p>
      <p>The general public will be able to see the total number of UhX tokens currently sold, as well as the distribution of all UhX tokens between the participating Stellar accounts. In the spirit of openness, the Company will constantly update on the Website the number of tokens sold as well as the share of UhX tokens allocated to the shareholders of Company. Furthermore, the Stellar accounts used to store XLM during the UhX sale duration will publicly available and their balances will also be made available on the Website.</p>
      <h2>5. After the UhX Token Sale</h2>

      <p>Upon the conclusion of a successful UhX sale, the digital assets backing each UhX token will be transparently purchased.</p>
      <p>The Company will provide you with an official and regular audit conducted on the existence of the digital assets backing each UhX token. Through this audit, you can track and confirm that the digital assets backing your UhX have been received and acquired. Access to the audit results does not constitute a UhX purchase receipt or indicate in any way that the party possessing such access has rights to or ownership of the purchased UhX tokens.</p>
      <p>Prior to a Purchaser selling UhX after the UhX token sale completion, such Purchaser shall ensure that the buyer of any such UhX undertakes to comply with all the provisions of these Terms as if such person were a Purchaser in the UhX token sale.</p>
      <h2>6. The Company Will Not Purchase UhX During the UhX Sale</h2>
      <p>The Company warrants that neither it nor its shareholders will purchase UhX during the UhX sale. Furthermore, the Company warrants that neither it nor its shareholders will purchase UhX from any third party during the period of the UhX sale.</p>
      <h2>7. All purchases of UhX are final</h2>
      <p>ALL PURCHASES OF UhX ARE FINAL. PURCHASES OF UhX ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. BY PURCHASING UhX, THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS OR SHAREHODELRS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.</p>

      <h2>8. Taxation of UhX and Taxation Related to the Token Sale</h2>
      <p>The Purchaser bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase of UhX with BTC, LTC, XLM or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of UhX over time has tax implications for the Purchaser in the Purchaser's home jurisdiction. By purchasing UhX, and to the extent permitted by law, the Purchaser agrees not to hold any of the Company, its affiliates, shareholders, director, or advisors liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the purchase of UhX.</p>
      <h2>9. Privacy</h2>
      <p>The Purchasers may be contacted by email by the Company. Such emails will be informational only. The Company will not request any information from Purchasers in an email. See our Privacy Policy available on the Website for additional information</p>
      <h2>10. Force Majeure</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>unavoidable casualty</li>
        <li>delays in delivery of materials</li>
        <li>embargoes</li>

      </ul>
      <p>or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other's inability to perform may elect to suspend the Terms, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The party experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured party.</p>
      <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>THE PURCHASER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE PURCHASER IS PURCHASING UhX AT THE PURCHASER'S SOLE RISK AND THAT UhX IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED).

      <h2>15. No Waiver</h2>
      <p>The failure of the Company to require or enforce strict performance by the Purchaser of any provision of these Terms or the Company’s failure to exercise any right under these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.

      <h4>ANNEX A</h4>
      <h1>UhX Risks</h1>
      <p>By purchasing, owning, and using UhX, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</p>
      <h2>1. Risk of Losing Access to UhX Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error</h2>
      <p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of UhX stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing UhX will result in loss of such UhX. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your UhX. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store UhX in, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your UhX. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving UhX, or provides an address that is not compatible, may result in the loss of your Tokens.</p>
      <h2>2. Risks Associated with the Stellar Protocol</h2>
      <p>Because UhX and the UhX | the Universal Healthcoin platform are based on the Stellar protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Stellar protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform or UhX. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the UhX and the platform, including the utility of the UhX for obtaining services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Stellar protocol.</p>
      <h2>3. Risk of Mining Attacks</h2>
      <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Stellar protocol, UhX are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating UhX transactions on the Stellar blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the platform and UhX, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving UhX.</p>
      <h2>4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</h2>
      <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the platform or UhX in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the platform is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the platform, which could negatively affect the platform and UhX, including the utility of UhX for obtaining services.</p>
      <h2>5. Risks Associated with Markets for UhX</h2>
      <p>If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to UhX (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.</p>
      <h2>6. Risk of Uninsured Losses</h2>
      <p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, UhX are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer recourse to you.</p>
      <h2>7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</h2>
      <p>The regulatory status of UhX and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the UhX | the Universal Healthcoin platform and UhX. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the platform and UhX. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the platform and UhX in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and delivery of UhX constitutes unlawful activity or that UhX are a regulated instrument that require registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale and delivery thereof. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
      <h2>8. Risks Arising from Taxation</h2>
      <p>The tax characterization of UhX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing UhX, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.</p>
      <h2>9. Risk of Competing platforms</h2>
      <p>It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the UhX | the Universal Healthcoin services.</p>
      <h2>10. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</h2>
      <p>Because UhX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the UhX | the Universal Healthcoin platform or the Company, all decisions involving the Company’s products or services within the platform or the Company itself will be made by the Company at its sole discretion. These decisions could adversely affect the platform and the utility of any UhX you own, including their utility for obtaining services.</p>
      <h2>11. Unanticipated Risks</h2>
      <p>Cryptographic tokens such as UhX are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Annex A of these Terms, there are other risks associated with your purchase, possession and use of UhX, including unanticipated risks. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Annex A of these Terms.</p>

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>I understand, acknowledge and agree as follows:</p>
      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>Terms not defined herein will be as defined in the White Paper and Terms and Conditions (collectively, the Token Sale Terms) located at https://UhX.io (the Website).</p>
      <p>References to Token Sale Terms and the Articles are to those documents as they may be amended from time to time.</p>
      <h2>White Paper and/or Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p>I have received and reviewed: (i) the Token Sale Terms and have taken appropriate legal and tax advice with respect to the same.</p>
      <p>I understand that UhX tokens do not represent nor do they entitle the holder, in any way whatever, to a:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Depository Account;</li>
        <li>Custodial Account;</li>
        <li>Cash Value Insurance Contract;</li>
        <li>Annuity Contract; or</li>
        <li>Equity and/or Debt Interest in UhX | the Universal Healthcoin;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>as such terms are defined in the Tax Information Authority (International Tax Compliance) (Common Reporting Standard) Regulations, 2015, BTLG1-8265751-5.</p>
      <h2>Terms of Tokens</h2>
      <p>UhX tokens are held subject to the terms and conditions of the Token Sale Terms and this Application (this Application).</p>
      <p>No certificate will be issued to in relation to my UhX tokens and my personal UhX token holding will not be reflected, recognized or recorded in any account or ledger maintained by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin.</p>
      <h2>Acquisition and Reversion</h2>
      <p>I understand that Acquisitions and Reversions will be processed by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin as per its Token Sale Terms. For the purposes of this Application, a "Reversion" means a transaction directly between UhX | the Universal Healthcoin and you whereby UhX token registered on your public key revert back to a public key owned or controlled by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or its affiliates in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <p>I understand that, prior to any purchase of UhX tokens, I must pay cash or Digital Currency (Contributed Amount) to UhX | the Universal Healthcoin in accordance with the Token Sale Terms to the cryptocurrency address indicated by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin.</p>
      <p>Upon acceptance of my request to buy UhX tokens, the Contributed Amount will be converted for UhX tokens in accordance with the Token Sale Terms.</p>
      <p>Any Reversion proceeds realized and due to me following a Reversion of UhX tokens held by me at the point of Reversion (Reversion Proceeds) in accordance with Token Sale Terms shall be paid to me as soon as practicable in the manner set forth in the Token Sale Terms. Contributed Amount or Reversion Proceeds shall be transferred and/or reflected on the same Digital Currency address from which the Contributed Amount was originally remitted unless such account or Digital Currency address has been changed and notified to UhX | the Universal Healthcoin and all relevant anti-money laundering and other verification procedures have been complied with prior to withdrawal. No Contributed Amount or Reversion Proceeds shall be paid to any Third Party account in respect of UhX tokens held by me and reverted.</p>
      <p>I acknowledge and understand that, for so long as any Reversion Proceeds are held as assets of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin, I shall accept the risk that a creditor of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin may seek to and may be successful in securing discharge of a liability of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin out of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin assets, thereby materially adversely affecting the value of my Contributed Amount and/or Reversion Proceeds and potentially reducing one or both to zero. Furthermore, I acknowledge that any interest accruing with respect to such Contributed Amount and/or Reversion Proceeds held in this manner shall be for the benefit of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin only.</p>
      <h2>Anti-Money Laundering</h2>
      <p>UhX | the Universal Healthcoin (and/or its delegate) may request such evidence as is necessary to verify the identity and source of funds of a prospective token purchaser and to confirm the AML status of any redeeming UhX token holder. UhX | the Universal Healthcoin shall not accept or repay any Contributed Amount and/or application for UhX tokens and shall not pay any Reversion Proceeds until all information required for verification purposes has been provided.</p>
      <p>If, as a result of any information or other matter which comes to his attention, any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to: (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Law (Revised) of the Cayman Islands if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering; or (ii) a police constable not below the rank of inspector, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Law (Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property. Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.</p>
      <p>UhX | the Universal Healthcoin prohibits acceptance of funds by any persons or entities that are acting, directly or indirectly: (i) in contravention of any U.S. or international laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering regulations or conventions; (ii) on behalf of terrorists or terrorist organizations, including those persons or entities that are included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control [1] (“OFAC”), as such list may be amended from time to time; (iii) for a senior foreign political [2] figure, any member of a senior foreign political figure’s immediate family or any close associate of a senior foreign political, unless the UhX | the Universal Healthcoin, after being specifically notified in writing that the Purchaser is such a person, conducts further due diligence, and determines that such acquisition shall be permitted; or (iv) for a foreign shell bank [3] (such persons or entities in (i) – (iv) are collectively referred to as “Prohibited Persons”).</p>
      <h2>Tax Information Exchange Obligations</h2>
      <p>I acknowledge that UhX | the Universal Healthcoin may be subject to certain obligations (the Tax Information Exchange Obligations) to gather and disclose to the competent authorities information relating to purchasers of UhX token under: (i) the United States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act provisions enacted under the United States Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act and any guidance, or regulations relating thereto (FATCA); (ii) any other legislation, regulations or guidance enacted in any jurisdiction which seeks to implement similar tax reporting, tax information exchange, reporting and/or withholding tax regimes (including the OECD Common Reporting Standard on the automatic exchange of financial account information); (iii) any intergovernmental Application between the Cayman Islands (or any Cayman Islands government body) and the U.S., the U.K. or any other jurisdiction (including any government bodies in any other such jurisdiction), entered into, in order to comply with, facilitate, supplement or implement the legislation, regulations or guidance described in (i) and (ii), including the OECD Multilateral Competent Authority Application; and (iv) any legislation, regulations or guidance in the Cayman Islands that give effect to the foregoing.</p>
      <p>I shall execute properly and provide to UhX | the Universal Healthcoin in a timely manner any documentation or other information that UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or its agents may request in writing from time to time in connection with the Tax Information Obligations. I waive any provision under the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction that would, absent a waiver, prevent or inhibit UhX | the Universal Healthcoin's compliance with applicable law as described in this paragraph, including but not limited to by preventing either (i) the Purchaser from providing any requested information or documentation, or (ii) the disclosure by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin and its agents of the provided information or documentation to applicable regulatory authorities.</p>
      <p>Without limitation, I shall provide any documentation or other information regarding myself and my beneficial owners requested by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or its agents in connection with the Tax Information Exchange Obligations.</p>
      <p>If I provide information and/or documentation that is in anyway misleading, or I fail to provide UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or its agents or delegates with the information and documentation that has been requested, (whether or not such action or inaction leads to compliance failures by UhX | the Universal Healthcoin, or a risk of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or its token holders being subject to withholding tax or other penalties), UhX | the Universal Healthcoin reserves the right:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to take any action and/or pursue all remedies at UhX | the Universal Healthcoin's disposal including, without limitation, compulsory Reversion of my UhX tokens in full or in part; and</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Further, I shall have no claim against UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or Smart Contract Supporter, or either of their agents or delegates, for any form of damages or liability as a result of actions taken or remedies pursued by or on behalf of UhX | the Universal Healthcoin or Smart Contract Supporter in order to comply with the Tax Information Exchange Obligations.</p>
